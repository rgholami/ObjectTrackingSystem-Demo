Bellow is the though process for solving the object tracking system/Panospheric Camera mounted on robot).

The solution can also be addressed/devloped using K-Mean algorithum from Machine Learing domain

1-The approach to solving this problem is grouping the features into three (3) clusters.
2- Assumed three (3 ) centroids (cluster of points read by Panospheric camera)
3-initially, assumed/estimated center for three clusters 
4- started reading an array of input (of theta values) 

1- Correctness on test cases : 
-the centroid of each cluster computed vs coresponding output are very close in vlaues
2-Simplicity / Elegance:
- The code is Java lanugage and simple, with no dependencies to avoid versioning and compatibility.
3-Maintainability, i.e. modularity, readability, structure, style, etc.:
- code is readable and based on java concept and features
4-Performance (but don't sacrifice readability for performance)
- the code is mainly written for readability and easy to follow and understand.
5-FYI-Developmemt Tools
The trade-off is in favor of readability. The code is developed in Java 8 (build 1.8.0_121-b13) 
on Eclispe IDE ( 4.13)
