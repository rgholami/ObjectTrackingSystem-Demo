# ObjectTrackingSystem-Demo
Problem statement:
We will develop part of the processing pipeline for an object tracking system.
We have a mobile robot that needs to detect obstacles in its environment so that it
can avoid them. One of the robot's sensors is a panospheric camera mounted on
top of a central mast that captures 360-degree panoramas of the robot's
environment.

Solution methodology includes appling K-Mean algorithm to find three(3) clusters have been discussed,
Test case results are documented at the end Java code file, and data analysis
on selected centroids for clusters are discussed in Wiki tab. https://github.com/rgholami/ObjectTrackingSystem-Demo/wiki/Readme--instruction--Discussion
